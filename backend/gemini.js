import axios from "axios";

const geminiResponse = async (command, assistantName, userName) => {
    try {
        const apiUrl = process.env.GEMINI_API_URL;
        console.log("Gemini URL:", apiUrl);

        const prompt = `You are a virtual assistant named ${assistantName} created by 
        ${userName}.

  "get-time" | "get-date" | "get-day" | "get-month"|"calculator-open" |
  "instagram_open" |"facebook_open" |"weather-show",
  "userinput": "<original user input>" {only remove your name from userinput if
exists} and agar kisi ne google ya youtube pe kuch search karne ko bola hai to
userInput me only bo search baala text jaye,
  "response": "<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
}
